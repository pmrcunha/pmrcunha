# Hi there ðŸ‘‹  
Glad you're reading this instead of LinkedIn!
I suppose you heard of me somewhere and are trying to figure out what I'm all about.
So I'll try to tell you. ðŸ˜ƒ

## How I met your monad  
I used to be an architect, and helped design some very nice [offices](https://www.mer.se/portfolio/)! 
In architecture school, I learned to code, and believe it or not, Lisp is my first language ðŸ™ƒ. 
When I graduated, I decided I would build my own portfolio website. I never finished that website, but I 
also never stopped learning, and here I am still. After a couple of years, what was hobby became career
(and what was career is still a hobby today).  

I got my start at [Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/), where curiosity paid off, as given my knowledge of React, I got to join the newly formed 
Platform Team. In 2 years, we worked on 3 major initiatives - _migrating from AngularJS to React, building a design system,
and migrating to a microsites architecture_. It's where I learned that good (software) architecture depends as much on
the technical requirements, as on the organization that will have to adopt it.  

I left Trustpilot to pursue an old dream of building better tools for architects to work with. 
Besides trying to design a complex product from scratch, I got to spend more time with the language I had been
playing with - Rust. I mostly built POCs to get to know what I didn't knew (A LOT), and built very basic versions
of a rendering engine, an interpreter for a DSL, a version control system, and an ECS (Entity Component System).
Also spent more time than I should have exploring build systems and web assembly ðŸ˜…

Eventually it became time to get a job again, and I found myself at Dixa, in the AI team. Long story short(er),
I started building the frontend for prototypes of AI features, and found myself leading the team. We had way more 
need of people to setup services and pipelines to put AI models in production than to build UI, so that's what I
learned and got my hands on. It's also when I started to think more about the processes and approaches that 
make a team productive, while its members stay happy and keep growing, which has been a big part of my career to this day.

(you were expecting me to tell you how I spent a year in a cave writing Haskell, weren't you? Sorry to disappoint ðŸ˜„)

## What I'm up to these days  
My latest interests and personal project time are dedicated to increasing freedom and privacy - in particular I've been
working on projects related to the [nostr protocol](https://nostr.com/). I also run an home server (or two ðŸ˜›), and build some
apps for my own consumption, to replace some cloud service I was mindlessly relying on. And naturally, I've been seeing how
much I can convince some friendly AI agents to help me with these endevours. ðŸ¤–

## Stack
I spend my days writing **Typescript**, primarily **React**. Started some projects with **HTMX**, but the React ecosystem always ends up dragging me back. ðŸ˜… 
When I need more performance, correctness or to be closer to the machine, I go for **Rust**. Also built some smaller projects in **Go** and found it enjoyable.
For the AI stuff, I naturally had to use **Python**, which I found very easy to pick up - except for the dependency management that gave me loooots of headaches.
